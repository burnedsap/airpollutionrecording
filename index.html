              ‘My house is ill!’ is a speculative exhibit that invites you to a
              home adapting to persistent air pollution in Delhi.
            </p>
            <p>
              Housed within an apartment in Khirki village, the project exists
              at the intersection of architecture, new media and ecology to
              study air pollution micro-climates within indoor environments and
              investigate patterns that are otherwise unseen.

            A message ticker running across the living room greets visitors upon
            entry. The house seems to speak to the occupant, asking them how are
            they doing and making conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ticker-system is connected to a network of particle-sensors
            around the house that share health status of different spaces and
            offer real-time notifications and recommendations on how the air
            quality microclimate is changing inside the house, and how it
            compares to the levels on the street outside.

            Each room in the apartment reflects the real-time pollution levels
            in the colour spectrum from blue to red (indicating low to high
            particulate matter presence respectively). The colour of lighting in
            the house reflects the safety levels of different spaces allowing
            the occupants to navigate the air pollution microclimates within the
            house.

            The project acts as a speculation of how our homes could evolve in
            the near future. What happens to windows when air outdoors isn’t
            fresh anymore?

            The interventions in the apartment drew from our experiments in an
            apartment in the urban village of Khirkee. The lab attempted to
            understand how air moves around within a house; how pollution
            resides in indoor and outdoor spaces; and how this information could
            be recorded and shared effectively.

          <p>
            One of the primary reasons we're unable to truly comprehend how
            polluted our air — is our inability to understand how air works. The
            8-week test lab in Khirkee village, Delhi was aimed to answer some
            of our curiosities — understanding how air moves around within a
            house; how pollution resides in indoor and outdoor spaces; and how
            this information could be recorded and shared effectively.

            The first phase of the project was intended to understand how air
            travels. Visualising air flow seemed critical to understand how
            pollution resides in our immediate environment.

            Analogue mediums → Can smoke from incense sticks tell us the

            The next step was to build a portable PM particle sensor assembly
            where multiple units could connect and transmit values over a
            wireless network. Details of our code and hardware setups are
            documented in a repository - open for access and use.

            We understand and acknowledge air pollution as relative changes in
            visibility, smell and colour of air around us. Absolute AQI readings
            on public information boards and mobile apps therefore, seem
            arbitrary — making it difficult to act upon.
